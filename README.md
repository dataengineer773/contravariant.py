i have make simplifying assumptions to classify trash in a neat hirarchy, Refuse : is the most general type of trash,All trash is refuse, Biodegradable : is a specefic type of trash that can be decomposed by organism
over time.Some Refuse is not Biodegradable, Compostable : is a specefic type of Biodegradable trash that can be effcientlt turned into oraganic fertilizer in a compost bin or in a composing facility.Not all Biodegradable
trash is Compostable in our definition.I have model the rule for an acceptable trash can in the cafeteria, we need to introduce the concept of"contravariance" through an example using it.
